                        Common causes include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Family histroy. </strong>You're at a higher risk for developing depression if you
                            have a family histroy of depression or another mood disorder. </li>
                        <li><strong>Early childhood trauma. </strong>Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear
                            or stressful situations. </li>
                        <li><strong>Brain structure. </strong>There's a greater risk if the frontol lobe of your brain
                            is less active. However, scientists don't know if this happens before or after the onset of
                            depressive symptoms. </li>
                        <li><strong>Medical conditions. </strong>Certain conditions may put you at a higher risk, such
                            as chronic illness, insomnia, chronic pain, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
                            (ADHD).</li>
                        <li><strong>Drug use. </strong>A histroy of drug or alcohol misuse can affect you risk. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        About 21 percent of people who have a substance use problem also experience depression.
                        In addition to these causes, other risk factors for depression include:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>low self-esteem or being self-critical</li>
                        <li>personal histroy of mentals illness</li>
                        <li>certain medications</li>

                    <p>
                        Many factors can influence feelings of depression, as well as who develops the condition and who

                    <p>
                        The causes of depression are often tied to other elements of your health.

                    <p>
                        However, in many cases, healthcare providers are unable to determine what's causing depression.

                <h3>Depression Test</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="col col-sm col-md">
                <p>There isn't a single test to diagnose depression. But your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis
                    based on your symptoms and a psychological evaluation.</p>
                <p>In most cases, they'll ask a series of questions about your:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>moods</li>
                    <li>appetite</li>
                    <li>sleep pattern</li>
                    <li>activity level</li>
                    <li>thoughts</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Because depression can be linked to other health problems, your healthcare provider may also
                    conduct a physical examination and order blood work. Sometimes thyroid problems or a vitamin D
                    deficiency can trigger symptoms of depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't ignore symptoms of depression. If your mood doesn't improve
                    or gets worse, seek medical help. Depression is a serious mental health illness with the potential
                    for complications.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If left untreated, complications can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>weight gain or loss</li>
                    <li>physical pain</li>

                        and worthlessness that don't go away on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                <div>
                    <h5>Persistent depressive disorder</h5>
                    <p>Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) used to be called dysthymia. It's a milder, but chronic,
                        form of depression.</p>
                    <p>In order for the diagnosis to be made, symptoms must last for at least 2 years. PDD can affect
                        your life more than major depression becausse it lasts for a longer period.</p>
                    <p>
                        It's common for people with PDD to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>lose interest in normal daily activities</li>
                        <li>feel hopeless</li>

                <p>Living wiht depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve
                    your quality of life. Talk to your healthcare provider about possible options.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col">
                <p>It's common to combine medical treatments and lifestyle therapies,
                    including the following:
                </p>
                <h5>Medications</h5>
                <p>Your healthcare provider may prescribe:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>antidepressants</li>
                    <li>antianxiety</li>
                    <li>antipsychotic medications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each type of medication that's used to treat depression has benefits and potential risks.</p>

                <h5>Psychotherapy</h5>
                <p>Speaking with a therapist can help you learn skills to cope with
                    negative feelings. You may also benefit from family or group therapy sessions.
                </p>

                <h5>Light Therapy</h5>
                <p>Exposure to doses of white light can help regulate your mood and improve
                    symptoms of depression. Light therapy is commonly used in seasonal affective disorder,
                    which is now called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern.
                </p>

                <h5>Alternative Therapies</h5>
                <p>
                    Ask your healthcare provider about acupuncture or meditation. Some
                    herbal supplements are also used to treat depression,
                    like St. John’s wort, SAMe, and fish oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talk with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement
                    or combining a supplement with prescription medication
                    because some supplements can react with certain medications.
                    Some supplements may also worsen depression or reduce the
                    effectiveness of medication.
                </p>


                <h5>Exercise</h5>
                <p>
                    Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity 3 to 5 days a week.
                    Exercise can increase your body’s production of endorphins,
                    which are hormones that improve your mood.
                </p>

                <h5>Avoid alcohol and drugs</h5>
                <p>
                    Drinking or misusing drugs may make you feel better for a little bit.
                    But in the long run, these substances can make depresion and anxiety symptoms worse.
                </p>

                <h5>Learn how to say no</h5>
                <p>
                    Feeling overwhelmed can worsen anxiety and depresion symptoms.
                    Setting boundries in your professional and personal life can help you feel better.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can also improve symptoms of depresion by taking care of youself.
                    This includes getting plenty of sleep, eating a healthy diet, avoiding negative
                    people, and participating in enjoyable activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes depresion doesn't respond to medication. Your healthcare provider
                    may recommend other treatment options if your symptoms don't improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These include <strong>electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</strong>, or
                    <strong>repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation (rTMS)</strong>
                    to treat depresion and improve your mood.

            <div class="col">
                <p>
                    Traditional depresion treatment uses a combination of prescription
                    medication and counseling. But there are also alternative
                    or complementry treatments you can try.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to remember that many these natural treatments have
                    few studies showing their effects on depression, good or bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talk to your healthcare provider before adding supplements to your treatment plan.

                <h4>Supplements</h4>
                <p>
                    Several types of supplements are thought to have some positive effect on depression symptoms.
                </p>

                <h5>St. John's wort</h5>
                <p>Studies are mixed, but this natural treatment is used in Europe as an antidepressant medication. In
                    the United States, it hasn’t received the same approval.</p>

                <h5>S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)</h5>
                <p>
                    This compound has shown in limited studies to possibly ease symptoms of depression. The effects were
                    best seen in people taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of traditional
                    antidepressant.
                </p>

                <h5>5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)</h5>
                <p>5-HTP may raise serotonin levels in the brain, which could ease symptoms. Your body makes this
                    chemical when you consume tryptophan, a protein building block.</p>

                <h5>Omega-3 fatty acids</h5>
                <p>These essential fats are important to neurological development and brain health. Adding omega-3
                    supplements to your diet may help reduce depression symptoms.</p>

                <p>Depression isn’t generally considered to be preventable. It’s hard to recognize what causes it, which

                                symptoms of anxiety.

                                Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder. It causes unwanted
                                and repeated thoughts, urges, and fears (obsessions).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These fears cause you to act out repeated behaviors or rituals (compulsions) that you
                                hope will ease the stress caused by the obsessions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                People diagnosed with OCD frequently find themselves in a loop of obsessions and
                                compulsions. If you have these behaviors, you may feel isolated because of them. This
                                can lead to withdrawal from friends and social situations, which can increase your risk
                                for depression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s not uncommon for someone with OCD to also have depression. Having one anxiety
                                disorder can increase your odds for having another. Up to 80 percentTrusted Source of
                                people with OCD also have major depression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This dual diagnosis is a concern with children, too. Their compulsive behaviors, which
                                may be first developing at a young age, can make them feel unusual. That can lead to
                                withdrawing from friends and can increase the chance of child developing depression.

                                Some individuals who have been diagnosed with major depression may also have symptoms of
                                another mental disorder called psychosis. When the two conditions occur together, it’s
                                known as depressive psychosis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Depressive psychosis causes people to see, hear, believe, or smell things that aren’t
                                real. People with the condition may also experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness,
                                and irritability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The combination of the two conditions is particularly dangerous. That’s because someone
                                with depressive psychosis may experience delusions that cause them to have thoughts of
                                suicide or to take unusual risks.
                            </p>

                                It’s unclear what causes these two conditions or why they can occur together, but
                                treatment can successfully ease symptoms. Treatments include medications and
                                electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
                            </p>

                    Depression can be temporary, or it can be a long-term challenge. Treatment doesn’t always make your
